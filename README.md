# Workout-Week-Randomizer

An average exercise week consists of the following: 
Shoulders, Biceps, Triceps, Legs, Back, Chest, 2 days of Cardio.

This program will randomly take 2 exercises and assign it to a day, creating a random 5 day exercise list.
Usually cardio and strength training aren't mixed into one day, so cardio will always be 1 day.
